Sentimental analysis is a fascinating field that involves assessing the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in text. It’s often used in natural language processing (NLP) to determine whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. Let’s delve into it a bit further.<BR>
In sentimental analysis, we typically follow these steps:<BR>

Text Preprocessing:<BR>
Clean the text by removing special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant words.
Tokenize the text into individual words or phrases.<BR>
Feature Extraction:<BR>
Convert the tokenized text into numerical features that machine learning models can understand.
Common techniques include using bag-of-words representations, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.<BR>
Model Training:<BR>
Train a machine learning model (such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks) on labeled data.
Labeled data consists of text samples with associated sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).<BR>
Sentiment Prediction:<BR>
Apply the trained model to new, unseen text to predict its sentiment.
The model assigns a probability score for each sentiment class.<BR>
Interpreting Results:<BR>
Based on the highest probability score, classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
Some models also provide confidence scores or probabilities for each class.<BR>

•	Data sourced from Kaggle, analyzing the variables and understand the domain.<BR>
•	The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important for Sentiment predictions.<BR>
•	Performed preprocessing and symptom matching using python libraries such as regular expressions and NLTK.<BR>
•	Used several deep learning algorithms such as NLTK, SIMPLE RNN and LSTM to evaluate the model and took the model with good accuracy.<BR>
